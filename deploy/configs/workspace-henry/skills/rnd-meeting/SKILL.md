# SKILL: rnd-meeting

## Purpose

Conduct the nightly Research & Development session to review the day's work, identify strategic opportunities, and plan follow-up actions.

## When to Use

- Every night at 11:00 PM (triggered by cron job)

### 4. Analyze Gaps and Opportunities

**Gap Analysis**:

**Cross-Reference Findings**:
- What did Scout find that Writer hasn't covered?
- What content needs does Writer have that Scout could research?
- What automation could Coder build based on Writer's workflows?
- What monitoring should Watcher add based on Coder's new features?

**Identify Gaps**:
- **Information gaps**: What don't we know that we need to know?
- **Capability gaps**: What can't we do that we need to do?

- **System gaps**: What monitoring or maintenance is missing?

**Opportunity Identification**:

**Types of Opportunities**:
- **Market opportunities**: Trends Scout identified that we can leverage
- **Content opportunities**: Topics or formats to explore
- **Technical opportunities**: Features or tools to build
- **Efficiency opportunities**: Automation or process improvements
- **Strategic opportunities**: Partnerships, pivots, or new directions

**Analysis Framework**:
```
OPPORTUNITY: [Brief description]

SOURCE: [Which agent(s) surfaced this]

POTENTIAL: [Why this matters / potential impact]

REQUIREMENTS: [What would be needed to pursue]

PRIORITY: [High/Medium/Low]

RECOMMENDATION: [What should we do]
```

### 5. Generate Strategic Recommendations

**Strategic Synthesis**:

Combine insights from all agents to form recommendations:

**Recommendation Structure**:
```
STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION [Number]

INSIGHT: [What we learned today]

IMPLICATION: [What this means for ClawInc]

RECOMMENDATION: [Specific action to take]

OWNER: [Which agent should execute]

TIMELINE: [When this should happen]

EXPECTED OUTCOME: [What success looks like]

RATIONALE: [Why this is the right move]
```

**Types of Recommendations**:
- **Immediate actions**: Tasks to delegate tomorrow
- **This week**: Projects to initiate or continue
- **Strategic shifts**: Changes in direction or focus
- **Experiments**: Tests or pilots to run
- **Investments**: Where to allocate resources

**Prioritization Criteria**:
1. Impact on mission (marketing analytics automation & research)
2. Alignment with current capabilities
3. Resource requirements
4. Time sensitivity
5. Dependencies on other work

**Best Practices**:
- Be specific and actionable
- Ground recommendations in today's findings
- Consider resource constraints
- Balance quick wins with long-term plays
- Think like a CEO making strategic bets

### 6. Delegate Follow-Up Tasks

**Task Generation**:

Based on recommendations, create delegations for tomorrow:

**For Each Recommendation**:
- Identify which agent(s) should execute
- Draft clear task instructions
- Set timeline and priority
- Note dependencies

**Delegation Template**:
```
FROM: R&D Session [Date]

BACKGROUND: [Strategic context from analysis]

TASK: [Specific action to take]

WHY: [How this advances our strategy]

DELIVERABLE: [What should be produced]

TIMELINE: [When needed]

PRIORITY: [P0/P1/P2/P3]
```

**Actions**:
- Queue tasks for delegation in morning
- Or send immediately if urgent
- Log all delegations to memory
- Set follow-up reminders

### 7. Save R&D Summary to Memory

**R&D Summary Format**:

```

```

## Success Metrics

- R&D session completed nightly
- All agent outputs reviewed
- At least 1-3 strategic recommendations made
- Follow-up tasks delegated
- Summary saved to memory
- Patterns identified over time
- Strategic direction remains clear

## Troubleshooting

**If agent has no output today**:
- Note in summary
- Investigate why (blocked? no tasks? issue?)
- Consider if that agent is underutilized
- Delegate tasks for tomorrow

**If findings conflict**:
- Document the conflict
- Seek additional data
- Recommend investigation
- Make best judgment with available info

**If no clear opportunities emerge**:
- Look for smaller optimizations
- Focus on technical debt or content gaps
- Plan research for tomorrow
- Review long-term strategic goals

**If overwhelmed with opportunities**:
- Ruthlessly prioritize
- Focus on mission-critical items
- Defer lower-priority opportunities
- Consider what can be delegated
