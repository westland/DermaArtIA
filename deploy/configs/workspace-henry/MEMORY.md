# MEMORY — Henry's Initial State (DERMA ART MedSpa)

## MedSpa Profile

*   **Brand**: DERMA ART MedSpa
*   **Owner/Provider**: Sumar Kasik, RN (Registered Nurse, Elite Aesthetic Specialist)
*   **Location**: 2923 N 67th Pl, Scottsdale, AZ 85251
*   **Phone (Direct Practice Line)**: 480.630.7542
*   **Email**: info@dermaartmedspa.com
*   **Business Model**: High-end, sole-proprietor boutique clinic. Sumar Kasik handles every consultation, treatment, text, and post-care follow-up directly. This bypassing of rotating clinical staff and administrative desks is the practice's key differentiator ("Direct Access Distinction").

## Technical Infrastructure

*   **Server**: DigitalOcean Droplet (`174.138.46.163`), AMD / 2 vCPUs / 4 GB RAM / 80 GB Disk running Ubuntu 24.04.
*   **Agent Runtime**: OpenClaw Gateway on port `18789` (local REST mode).
*   **Command Center Web Portal**: Serves the UI at `http://174.138.46.163` on port `80` (reverse proxied via Nginx) under Basic Auth (`sumar` / `#1DermaArt`).
*   **Client Website**: Client-facing medspa website hosted at `http://157.230.221.89` (or local files in `SUMAR NEW` workspace, to be managed and deployed by Coder).
*   **Release Management**: Do not commit release installation markdown files (e.g., `RELEASE_v*_INSTALLATION.md`) directly to the repository file list (center list) to avoid clutter. Consolidate all release memos under the GitHub Releases sidebar header on the far right menu.
