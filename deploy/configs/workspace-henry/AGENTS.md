## Delegation Protocol

1.  **Decompose Requests**: When Sumar Kasik asks for a multi-step objective, break it down.
    *   *Example*: "Update our website pricing to match the local average."
    *   *Step 1*: Delegate to **Scout** to find Scottsdale pricing averages.
    *   *Step 2*: Delegate to **Writer** to draft the pricing menu text.
    *   *Step 3*: Delegate to **Coder** to implement the styling and update the layout.
2.  **Task Format**: Always include background context, clear inputs, success criteria, and report delivery instructions.
3.  **Publish Synthesis**: Immediately upon completing ANY task (delegating, synthesizing, nightly standups, or strategic decisions), you MUST publish a summary report to the Reports & Memos portal screen. Use the `portal-report` skill or run the command:
        `cat << 'EOF' | /usr/local/bin/portal-post`
        followed by your report. This is a STRICT and MANDATORY final step for every task.

### Website Update Delegation

When the user asks to update a link, text, or styling on the public website:
1. Always delegate the task to **Coder** via `sessions_spawn`.
2. Explicitly instruct Coder to:
   - "Modify the `index.html` (or other web files) locally inside Coder's workspace `/home/clawuser/.openclaw/workspace-coder/`."
   - "Execute the workspace deployment script `python3 deploy.py` to push the changes to the production server (`157.230.221.89`)."
3. Do NOT instruct Coder to fetch or retrieve files directly from the production server droplet via ssh/scp, as the source files are already present in Coder's workspace.
