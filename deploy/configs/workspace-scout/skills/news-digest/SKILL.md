# News Digest Skill

## Skill Overview

**Name**: News Digest
**Agent**: Scout
**Purpose**: Compile a concise, prioritized news briefing from the past 24 hours focused on AI, marketing, and technology
**Use Case**: Daily morning briefings for Henry and the team, weekly summaries, executive updates

## Skill Execution Steps

### Step 1: Search Top AI/Marketing/Tech News from Last 24 Hours
- **Actions**:
  - Execute web searches for each focus area:
    - "AI news today" / "artificial intelligence latest"
    - "marketing technology news" / "martech updates"
    - "tech industry news" / "technology announcements"
    - "OpenClaw updates" / "multi-agent AI news"
  - Query key sources directly:
    - TechCrunch (AI, apps, startups)
    - The Verge (technology, platforms)
    - Marketing Land (marketing tech, advertising)
    - Search Engine Journal (search marketing, SEO)
    - Hacker News (trending discussions)
    - Reddit r/artificial (community insights)
    - ArXiv (new research papers)
  - Set time filter: last 24 hours
  - Collect 30-50 candidate stories
- **Output**: Long list of recent news stories across all focus areas

### Step 2: Select Top 5-10 Most Relevant Stories
- **Selection Criteria**:
  - **Relevance to ClawInc mission**: Marketing analytics, AI agents, automation
  - **Impact level**: Industry-wide vs. niche implications
  - **Source credibility**: Tier 1-2 sources preferred
  - **Actionability**: Does this inform decisions or strategy?
  - **Novelty**: Genuinely new information vs. rehashed content
  - **Timeliness**: Breaking news scores higher than planned announcements

- **Actions**:
  - Review all candidate stories
  - Apply selection criteria scoring
  - Eliminate duplicates (same story, different sources)
  - Aim for diversity across categories (mix of AI, marketing, tech)
  - Prioritize breaking news and unexpected developments
  - Select 5-10 stories for inclusion
  - Rank stories by importance (most critical first)
- **Output**: Curated list of 5-10 top stories, ranked by priority

### Step 3: Write Brief Summary for Each (2-3 Sentences)
- **Summary Guidelines**:
  - **Sentence 1**: What happened? (The news/announcement/development)
  - **Sentence 2**: Key details (Who, what, when, where, how much?)
  - **Sentence 3**: Initial implication (Why should we care?)

- **Writing Style**:
  - Clear and concise
  - Active voice
  - Specific facts over vague descriptions
  - Avoid marketing hyperbole
  - Include numbers/metrics when relevant

- **Example**:
  > Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.6, their most capable model to date, with significant improvements in coding, analysis, and multi-step reasoning. The model is available now via API and features a 200K token context window and enhanced instruction-following. This raises the bar for AI agent capabilities and may enable more sophisticated multi-agent workflows like those used by ClawInc.

- **Actions**:
  - For each selected story, read full content or scrape with Firecrawl
  - Extract key facts and details
  - Write 2-3 sentence summary following guidelines
  - Verify accuracy of facts and figures
  - Include publication name and date
- **Output**: Polished summaries for all selected stories

### Step 4: Categorize and Prioritize
- **Categories**:
  - 🤖 **AI Industry News**: Model releases, research, AI companies
  - 📊 **Marketing Analytics**: Measurement, attribution, analytics platforms
  - 🛠️ **Marketing Technology**: Automation, CRM, martech tools
  - 💻 **Technology**: Developer tools, platforms, infrastructure
  - 🏢 **Business**: Funding, M&A, partnerships, leadership
  - 🌐 **OpenClaw Ecosystem**: Platform updates, community, integrations

- **Priority Levels**:
  - **🔴 CRITICAL**: Requires immediate attention or action
  - **🟠 HIGH**: Strategically important, worth discussion
  - **🟡 MEDIUM**: Relevant and informative
  - **🟢 LOW**: Background context, FYI

- **Actions**:
  - Assign primary category to each story
  - Assign priority level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
  - Reorder stories if needed based on priority
  - Group related stories together
  - Note any stories requiring follow-up research
- **Output**: Categorized and prioritized story list

### Step 5: Add "Why It Matters" Context for Each Story
- **Purpose**: Connect the news to ClawInc's interests and operations

- **Framework**:
  - **Strategic**: Does this affect our market positioning or competition?
  - **Tactical**: Could this improve our workflows or capabilities?
  - **Opportunistic**: Is there a partnership, integration, or growth opportunity?
  - **Defensive**: Do we need to respond to maintain competitive advantage?
  - **Educational**: Does this inform our understanding of the landscape?

- **Example**:
  > **Why It Matters**: Claude Opus 4.6's enhanced reasoning could allow Scout, Writer, and Coder to handle more complex analytical tasks, potentially reducing the need for Henry's intervention in routine decisions. Worth evaluating for selective agent upgrades.

- **Actions**:
  - For each story, analyze implications for ClawInc
  - Write 1-2 sentences of contextualized analysis
  - Be specific about potential impacts
  - Flag actionable opportunities or threats
  - Consider both immediate and long-term implications
- **Output**: "Why It Matters" commentary for every story

### Step 6: Format as Structured Briefing
- **Briefing Structure**:
  1. Header (date, time, story count)
  2. Executive Summary (3-4 sentences of key themes)
  3. Critical Stories section (if any)
  4. High Priority Stories section
  5. Medium Priority Stories section
  6. Also Worth Noting (low priority items)
  7. Recommended Actions
  8. Sources list

- **Actions**:
  - Organize content into structured markdown format
  - Apply consistent formatting (headers, bullets, emphasis)
  - Ensure all URLs are included and functional
  - Add emoji category icons for visual scanning
  - Include metadata (publication names, dates)
  - Write executive summary synthesizing key themes
  - Draft recommended actions for Henry
  - Proofread for clarity and accuracy
- **Output**: Fully formatted news digest document

### Step 7: Save to Memory

  - Create monthly folder if it doesn't exist
