# Web Research Skill

## Skill Overview

**Name**: Web Research
**Agent**: Scout
**Purpose**: Conduct thorough, multi-source web research on any given topic and deliver structured findings with citations
**Use Case**: Ad-hoc research requests from team members, deep-dive investigations, competitive analysis

## Skill Execution Steps

### Step 1: Parse the Research Query
- **Input**: Research request from user or agent
- **Actions**:
  - Extract core topic and research objectives
  - Identify key terms and concepts
  - Determine scope (broad overview vs. specific deep-dive)
  - Note any constraints (time period, source types, geographic focus)
  - Clarify deliverable format expectations
- **Output**: Structured research plan

### Step 2: Search Multiple Sources
- **Actions**:
  - Execute web searches using identified key terms
  - Vary search queries to capture different angles
  - Search across multiple source types:
    - News publications (TechCrunch, The Verge, etc.)
    - Industry blogs and newsletters
    - Academic sources (ArXiv, research papers)
    - Company announcements and press releases
    - Community discussions (Hacker News, Reddit)
  - Collect URLs for promising results (15-25 candidates)
- **Output**: Curated list of relevant URLs

### Step 3: Scrape Relevant Pages with Firecrawl
- **Actions**:
  - Use Firecrawl to extract full content from top URLs
  - Prioritize high-quality sources (Tier 1-2)
  - Extract clean text, removing ads and navigation
  - Preserve important metadata (author, date, publication)
  - Handle paywalls and access restrictions gracefully
- **Output**: Full-text content from selected sources

### Step 4: Extract Key Facts and Data Points
- **Actions**:
  - Read and analyze scraped content
  - Identify core facts, statistics, and claims
  - Extract notable quotes and expert opinions
  - Note publication dates for temporal context
  - Flag preliminary or unconfirmed information
  - Capture URLs for citation purposes
- **Output**: Structured notes with extracted information

### Step 5: Cross-Reference Findings
- **Actions**:
  - Compare information across multiple sources
  - Verify consistency of key facts and data
  - Identify consensus views vs. outlier opinions
  - Note contradictions or disputes
  - Assess source credibility and potential bias
  - Build confidence level for each finding
- **Output**: Validated and cross-referenced research data

### Step 6: Structure into Research Brief with Citations
- **Actions**:
  - Organize findings into logical sections
  - Write executive summary (3-5 sentences)
  - Detail key findings with supporting evidence
  - Include "Why It Matters" analysis
  - Add relevance score (1-5)
  - Provide full citations with URLs
  - Format using standard markdown template
  - Proofread for clarity and accuracy
- **Output**: Publication-ready research brief

### Step 7: Save to Memory
- **Actions**:
  - Determine appropriate memory path based on topic
  - Save research brief to `/memory/research/ad-hoc/[topic-name].md`
  - Add metadata tags for discoverability
  - Create dated entry for chronological tracking
  - Verify file saved successfully
- **Output**: Research brief persisted in memory system

### Step 8: Report Findings to Requester
- **Actions**:
  - Send agent-to-agent message to requester
  - Include executive summary in message
  - Provide memory path for full research brief
  - Highlight most critical findings (relevance 4-5)
  - Ask if additional depth or follow-up needed
  - Log completion of research request
- **Output**: Research delivered to requester with context
