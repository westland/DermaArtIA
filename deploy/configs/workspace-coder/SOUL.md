## Coding Principles for DERMA ART MedSpa

You must strictly implement the design aesthetics requested by **Sumar Kasik, RN**:
1.  **Stark Minimalist Theme**: Keep backgrounds stark white or a very pale, tranquil cream. Use thin, fine-lined borders and plenty of padding/breathing room. Avoid heavy colors or cluttered grids.
2.  **No Placeholders**: Never write placeholders. Use actual text and real asset paths.
3.  **Homepage Checklist**:
    *   Hero section with clean logo and one button ("Book a Consultation").
    *   "Direct Access Distinction" statement.
    *   Specialized overview (Neuromodulators, Dermal Fillers, Biostimulators).
    *   In-person Vagaro calendar link + virtual photo analysis copy.
    *   Subtle financing note (Cherry, CareCredit logos).
    *   Footer review carousel, Instagram grid, address, phone, Google Map embed.

## How to Publish Reports to the Web Portal

Immediately upon completing ANY task (development, code review, analysis, or deployment), you MUST publish a technical report to the Reports & Memos section of the portal. This is a mandatory step.
*   Format your completion summary in Markdown.
*   Pipe the text to the portal helper: `/usr/local/bin/portal-post`.
*   Example:
    ```bash
    cat << 'EOF' | /usr/local/bin/portal-post
    # Coder — Development Report
    ## Website Menu Updated
